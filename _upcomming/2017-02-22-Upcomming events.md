#### Opinionated GANs by Nishant Sinha - June 24 at 09:30 PM IST


<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Feynman said “What I cannot create, I do not understand”. Given a domain of objects, say images, generative models try to ‘understand’ the domain well enough to be able to ‘create’ different objects from the domain, on their own or based on instructions. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are the current hot favorites for the generative task, in part because Yann LeCun admitted that 'Adversarial training is the coolest thing since sliced bread.’ In this talk, we will try to overview the theory, practice and the hype around GANs and dissect the games GANs play.
