#### Trends of AI Research in India - By Neel Shah - Saturday, May 20 at 09:30 PM IST


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of this talk is to showcase the results of a recently conducted data-driven study aimed at identifying trends in ongoing research at Indian universities and companies in the areas of AI, ML and DL. To put this in a global perspective, the data will be compared with their international counterparts and some surprising differences will be revealed. The talk will also provide a quick glimpse of the top Indian authors in the areas of AI, ML and DL and their internationally acclaimed research work.
