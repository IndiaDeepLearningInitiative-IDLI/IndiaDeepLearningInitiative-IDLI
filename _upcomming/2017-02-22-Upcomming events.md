#### Why Deep Learning Works ? by Subrat - June 18 at 09:30 PM IST


<p style="text-align: justify;">As a part of this talk, which will be at the edge of Theory and Practical application, I will try to help understand why Deep Learning as a methodology works. And the limitations and perhaps the short comings of DL.
