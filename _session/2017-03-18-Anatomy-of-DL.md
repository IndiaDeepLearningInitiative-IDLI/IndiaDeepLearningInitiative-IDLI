<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost all current day DL work happens using Deep Learning frameworks. With so many around, it can get confusing what they are all trying to do. In this talk, I will be discussing how these frameworks work under the hood, how they all use the same concepts and how you could roll your own framework if you desire. I will be covering both high-level mathematical concepts as well as low-level implementation details in an accessible way.</p>
