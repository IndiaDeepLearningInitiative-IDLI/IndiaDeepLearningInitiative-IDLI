#### Introduction to Image Classification using Keras

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Keras is a minimalisitc Python Deep Learning library that works on top of TensorFlow or Theano. It helps to quickly prototype Deep Learning models, and works seamlessly with both CPUs and GPUs. In this talk you will learn about how to build a simple image classification model using Keras. This is going to be more hands-on demo with code.</p>
